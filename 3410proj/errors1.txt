Thank you for your PA1 submission!
We ran a collection of automated test programs on your processor to exercise its various functionalities. Here are the results:
[ 0 errors] Tests that ADDIU sign extends its immediate operand.
[ 0 errors] Tests that ANDI, ORI, XORI zero extend their immediate operands.
[ 0 errors] Tests the LUI instruction.
[ 0 errors] Tests hazards for LUI instructions.
[ 0 errors] Tests the MOVN and MOVZ instructions.
[ 4 errors] Tests hazards for MOV instructions where the operand is not moved.
    Error in register 23. Expected 0x00000008, but got 0x12345678.
    Error in register 24. Expected 0x00000008, but got 0x12345678.
    Error in register 26. Expected 0x00000008, but got 0x12345678.
    Error in register 27. Expected 0x00000008, but got 0x12345678.
[ 0 errors] Tests hazards for MOV instructions where the operand is moved.
[ 0 errors] Tests the R-type arithmetic and logic instructions.
[ 0 errors] Tests constant shifts.
[ 0 errors] Tests variable shifts with shift amounts < 32.
[ 0 errors] Tests variable shifts with shift amounts >= 32.
[ 2 errors] Tests forwarding of variable shift amount.
    Error in register 5. Expected 0x05800000, but got 0x00000016.
    Error in register 7. Expected 0x18000000, but got 0x00000018.
[ 0 errors] Tests the SLT instruction.
[ 0 errors] Tests the SLTI instruction.
[ 0 errors] Tests the SLTIU instruction.
[ 0 errors] Tests the SLTU instruction.
[ 0 errors] Ensures that I-type instructions work even if last six bits of immediate field match a function code of an R-type instruction.
[ 0 errors] Tests hazard detection: 1-cycle hazards.
[ 0 errors] Tests hazard detection: 2-cycle hazards.
[ 0 errors] Tests hazard detection: 3-cycle hazards.
[ 0 errors] Tests that the correct forwarding path is prioritized for simultaneous hazards.
[ 0 errors] Tests that hazards are resolved by bypassing, not by stalling.
[ 0 errors] Tests hazards: An I-type instruction writes to the same register as a previous R-type instruction. Immediate value must not be forwarded.
[ 4 errors] Tests that hazards involving $0 are handled correctly.
    Error in register 1. Expected 0x00000005, but got 0x00000011.
    Error in register 2. Expected 0x00000005, but got 0x00000011.
    Error in register 4. Expected 0x00000000, but got 0x00000018.
    Error in register 5. Expected 0x00000000, but got 0x00000018.
[ 0 errors] Runs all table B instructions, which should all be NOPs.
TOTAL: 10 errors
Tests with no errors: 22/25
